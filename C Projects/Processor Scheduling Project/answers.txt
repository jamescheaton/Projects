Problem 1B
----------

Increasing the number of CPUs decreases the execution time, but it is not a
linear realtionship. Increasing from 1 to 2 CPUs almost halves the execution
time but any further additions only result in small decreases.

Problem 2B
----------

See output.txt showing outputs for RR scheduler.
Whilst wait time decreasing with decreasing time slice, having the shortest
timeslice possible would severely decrease the throughput of the scheduler
since processes are constantly switching.

Problem 3B
----------

For one CPU, Round Robin algorithm produces the lowest waiting time. This is 
because FCFS suffers from convoy effect and SRTF suffers from starvation. Round
robin gives equal opportunity to all jobs.
